# Strong Password Generator

## Description

A password generator web app is a tool that allows users to create strong, unique, and random passwords for their online accounts. Users can customize the password length and include specific characters, such as numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters. The generated passwords are usually designed to be difficult to guess or crack, making them more secure than using simple and easily guessable passwords.
